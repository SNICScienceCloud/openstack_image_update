Image update script for openstack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The script exptects to be in /usr/local/share/openstack_image_update so if you
select another location you need to edit the files and change that.

Images are converted to raw before import with the qemu-img tool so you need to
install the qemu-utils package.

First make sure that you have the correct keys from the distributions.
The gpg keys in the keys directory are from 2017-04-03 and might be outdated.

Then you can import the keys

# cd /usr/local/share/openstack_image_update
# ./import_keys.sh

You can then run the script to make sure that you get all images.

# /usr/local/share/openstack_image_update/openstack_image_update.sh 

You can make a symlink in cron.daily to get daily image updates.

# ln -s /usr/local/share/openstack_image_update/openstack_image_update.sh /etc/cron.daily/openstack_image_update.sh
